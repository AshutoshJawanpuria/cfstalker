Have you ever tried stalking someone on codeforces?
It may be cumbersome  to repeatedly open their ID's to see the questions that they have practices

Here I have built a python engine which lets you know if someone has solved a question while it is running(and around 1 minute before starting the engine itself)

Tkinter is used for the GUI , which pops up a window if someone has solved a question with a button 
which leads you to the question itself which your friend/rival has solved

This Engine also shows the last 10 problems solved by the user

Updates to be made: 
1. A rating system, where you specify the rating above which you want to get notified
if your friend solves a problem
2. A file system wherein the last 10 problems solved will be saved to the file itself and
not be displayed to the terminal
3. This Engine would be made contest friendly where the questions are unrated and hence the current engine might fail during contests or unrated questions
